# tr1glidostextureextractor
Extracts textures from TR1's PHD files, which are named accordingly to how glidos dumps textures.

This utility was made in order to aid in making texture packs for [CroftEngine](https://github.com/stohrendorf/CroftEngine), as that supports glidos texture packs and it's graphical features really embrace using higher quality textures.

This tool on it's own does nothing but extract the textures of TR1, which can then be used as a base for creating your own texture packs. It's a hell of a lot better than running through each level yourself!
